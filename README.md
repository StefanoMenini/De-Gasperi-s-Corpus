# De-Gasperi-s-Corpus
A collection of Alcide De Gasperi's public documents with gold and silver annotation

The corpus of Alcide De Gasperi's public documents is a comprehensive collection of documents issued between 1901 and 1954, which had been previously published in four volumes by Il Mulino but were not machine-readable. Our repository contains all documents in three formats: txt, XML and tab-separated. Raw txt files contain only the body of the documents, and may be straightforwardly used to extract embeddings or topics. XML files include metadata that cover not only the title, the date and the place of publication, but also key-concepts automatically extracted from each text and genre labels manually assigned by domain experts. Furthermore, the release includes silver annotation for lemma, part of speech, person names and place names with associated coordinates in a CoNLL-like format.

An online platform to explore the corpus without downloading it can be accessed at http://alcidedigitale.fbk.eu
